This repository holds the code for ckbsim, a C based kilobot simulator. The simulator was developed in the [Swarm Organ project](www.swarm-organ.eu), and is distributed under the MIT license (see the file LICENSE for details). Installation instructions follow below. For detailed usage instruction and programming documentation, see `docs/manual.md` and the example bots in `examples/`.



## Prerequisites
You'll need to have:
- git
- cmake
- avr-gcc (c compiler for the AVR microcontroller, to compile for the kilobot)
- SDL 1.X (including headers for building, i.e. devel packages under linux)
- the [Jansson library](http://www.digip.org/jansson/) (though it's in many package managers. Again, get the development package)
- the [Check unit testing library](http://check.sourceforge.net/)


### Debian-based Linux systems
`sudo apt-get install build-essential git gcc-avr gdb-avr binutils-avr avr-libc avrdude libsdl1.2-dev libjansson-dev cmake check`

### OSX systems (incomplete)

check library:
`brew install check`

Sometimes, need to compile with
`C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include/ make`
for the libraries to be found.

## Build instructions

Make a build directory:

	mkdir build
	cd build

Run cmake:

	cmake ..

Install:

	sudo make install

This installs the kilobot simulator in a system-wide location, by default
under `/usr/local/lib` and `/usr/local/include`.


## Compile and run examples
cd examples
cd orbit
make     # or make -f Makefile.osx on OSX
./orbit -b start_positions.json


Note: the simulator uses the [SDL_GFX library](http://cms.ferzkopp.net/index.php/software/13-sdl-gfx)
by Andreas Schiffler (distributed under the zlib license). The source
code for the sdl_gfx library is bundled with the simulator due to its
unreliable availability in various Linux distributions. It is located in the
directory src/gfx, and is automatically compiled with the rest of the
source code.

The simulator also includes the API definitions of kilolib, the C
library for the physical kilobot robot. These are located in the file
src/kilolib.h, with minor, simulator-specific changes.
The full kilolib source code is here: https://github.com/acornejo/kilolib .
